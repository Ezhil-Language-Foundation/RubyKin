1) Store the value of 54 / 3 into the variable x. What is
the value of x?

2) Give the value of x (from problem 1) to y, a new
variable. Now make x equal to itself divided by 3. What’s
the value of x? What’s the value of y?

3) What if we performed some math on our variables? If we
set x to 12, what’s x divided by 3?

4) What’s the value of x now?
