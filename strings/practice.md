What is the result of each of the following?


1) puts "What is the return result" + " of " + "this operation?"

2) "This string minus" - "That string"

3) `"1234.55".to_i`

4) `"1234.55".to_f`

5) `"Not a number".to_i`

6) `puts "1\n2\n3\n"`

7) Why might it be useful that the to_i (to integer)
method return zero for strings that canâ€™t be
represented as numbers?

8) What do you think the length method does?
`"Count".length`

9) How about the split method?
`"Count".split("")`

10) What do you think slice does?
`"Count".slice(2)`
