# What is programming?


Programming is language. We use language to communicate with our friends. We use programming to communicate with our computers.

A program is nothing more than a set of instructions for the computer to execute. These instructions outline the plan or project, like a blueprint for a house. Without a blueprint, the builders wouldn’t know what the architect wants, just like the computer doesn’t know how to create what _you_ want without a program.

Learning a programming language is a lot like learning any language. First you start with the basic building blocks--the A, B, C's. Then you start learning how to put those blocks into words, sentences, and eventually commands that will tell your computer what to do.
