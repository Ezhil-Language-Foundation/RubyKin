What would the computer say? Try to do these in your head before going to IRB. Remember, the answers will be a boolean value, either true or false.

1) Is 3 > 5 ?

2) 3 < 5

3) 5 == 5

4) 10 >= 10

5) 10 <= 12

6) 10 != 10

7) 10.object\_id == 10.object\_id

What about strings?

8) "dog" == "cat"

9) "cat" == "cat"

10) "cat.object\_id" == "cat.object\_id"
