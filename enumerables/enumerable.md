# Enumerables


The Enumerable module is a collection of built-in Ruby methods that allow you to scan, sort, search and manipulate collections. Remember that collections come in two forms, hashes and arrays. Weâ€™ll cover four of the basic enumerables in this chapter:

  * each
  * each\_with\_index
  * select
  * map
