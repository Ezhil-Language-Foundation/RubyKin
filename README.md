This book is for any kids that want to learn how to code. Adults are welcome too.

With ten simple chapters, you will learn the basics inherent in all fundamental programming languages: variables, strings, numbers, methods, collections and more.

These are the basic building blocks used in modern programming languages today. By the end of this book, you will have learned what all these terms mean and how they are used to design a computer program.
